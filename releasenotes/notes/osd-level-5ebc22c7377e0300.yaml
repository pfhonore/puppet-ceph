features:
  - Added options to configure some osd parameters directly
    (instead of generic cephir::conf) this behavior is
    disabled by default. `osd/osd_max_backfills`,
    `osd_max_scrubs`, `osd/osd_recovery_max_active`,
    `osd_recovery_max_single_start`, `osd/osd_recovery_op_priority`,
    `osd/osd_op_threads`
upgrade:
  - when upgrading, move any usage of cephir::conf to ceph::init for the
    following parameters `osd/osd_max_backfills`,
    `osd_max_scrubs`, `osd/osd_recovery_max_active`,
    `osd_recovery_max_single_start`, `osd/osd_recovery_op_priority`,
    `osd/osd_op_threads`
deprecations:
  - cephir::init set_osd_params is added new as deprecated.
    This is to support backwards compability in this release.
    It will be removed in the next release. Please inspect your
    usage of cephir::conf for `osd/osd_max_backfills`,
    `osd_max_scrubs`, `osd/osd_recovery_max_active`,
    `osd_recovery_max_single_start`, `osd/osd_recovery_op_priority`,
    `osd/osd_op_threads` as these will become actively defined from
    cephir::init
