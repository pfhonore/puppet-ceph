features:
  - Updates 'ceph::rgw::keystone' to integrate with keystone V3.
    Adds new parameters rgw_keystone_admin_domain,
    rgw_keyston_admin_project, rgw_keystone_admin_user
    and rgw_keystone_admin_password.
    Extends rgw_keystone_version to add 'v3' as a valid option
issues:
  - At this time radosgw uses pki to verify Keystone revocation
    lists. 'keystone::enable_pki_setup' must be set to true
    to provide the needed keystone support
