    Improves support for the MDS service and adds a profile class for it.
features:
  - |
    The MDS class is extended to allow for binding address and instance ID
    configuration. It now also ensures that the needed packages for the MDS
    daemon are installed and that the service is manageable by Puppet.
  - |
    A new MDS profile class is added which, in addition to deploying the MDS
    service will create a new keyring for it, allowing MDS profilation and
    access to the OSD pools.
other:
  - |
    The package installed by default for the MDS service can be configured
    via cephir::params::pkg_mds
  - |
    The keyring for the MDS service is only created if a key is given, the
    key to use can be configured via cephir::profile::params::mds_key
